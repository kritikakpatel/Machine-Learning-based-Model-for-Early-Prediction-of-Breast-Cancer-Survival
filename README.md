# Machine-Learning-based-Model-for-Early-Prediction-of-Breast-Cancer-Survival

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the suggested deep learning network against existing model networks for breast cancer diagnosis. Image data is first processed, then classified, and then evaluated for effectiveness. In this study, we use the IDC dataset to assess the efficacy of the deep learning model network EfficientNetB7 for tumour classification. When comparing EfficientNetB7's 93% accuracy to that of the basic 95% accuracy, the results are clear.
